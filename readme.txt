Built and deployed using VS Code and PlatformIO plugin.

Patch RemoteDebug to fix build error.
The build is failing because this header was removed/moved in newer ESP32 cores; the widely used workaround is to replace:

#include <hwcrypto/sha.h>


with:

#include <esp32/sha.h>


This is exactly what people report as the fix for this same error.

Where to patch (your case)

PlatformIO is compiling:

.pio/libdeps/nodemcu-32s/RemoteDebug/src/utility/WebSockets.cpp


So open that file and change the include line near the top.

Minimal diff
-#include <hwcrypto/sha.h>
+#include <esp32/sha.h>


Then rebuild.
